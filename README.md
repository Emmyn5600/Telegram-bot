# `Telegram-inspirational--bot`

 > In this project, I built a Telegram Bot that gives you a daily inspirational quote and asks for your name and makes a joke about you. The main goal is to make a massive use of external API`s by putting into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming, classes, modules, objects and accessing their attributes. The project is built using the TDD technique.

## `How to find the bot on Telegram`

- To find the bot on Telegram, simply download the [desktop](https://telegram.org/) application and on mobile got to the play store (for android) and search for telegram or apple store(for ISO) and download the application.

- Create a Telegram account and simply search for the Bot with the username `@emmyn5600bot`.

- Run the command to `/start` and enjoy using the bot.

- Click this [link!](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@emmyn5600bot) to use the bot on the Browser.

## `You can see a short demo of the Bot /start command in the screenshot below`.

The **./bin** folder contains the executable **main.rb** file used to run a project.

The **./lib** folder contains subsidiary files that set up all of the classes used in bin/main.rb

- **bot.rb**, that holds all commands and token for the telegram bot.

- **inspiration.rb**, where the selected inspiration api is.

- **jokes.rb**, where the jokes api is.

The **./spec** folder contains all the relative spec tests

In addition to the above, the repo also contains .rubocop.yml for linting.
